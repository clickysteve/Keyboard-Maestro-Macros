## Macros 

Below is a description of the various macros and their function, in no particular order.

### WordPress related

This category is for various WordPress related, time saving macros when dealing with different sites. Created primarily to help with WordPress.com administration, but could prove useful in other situations.

* **Omnisearch** - Searches currently open WordPress site for the highlighted text.
* **Open Root WPCOM URL** - Takes URLs of specific files, posts, or pages on WordPress.com and strips it to the Root. For example, http://clickysteve.wordpress.com/blahblah/ to http://clickysteve.wordpress.com.
* **Open WP-Admin** - Opens the WP-ADMIN page of the WordPress site currently open in the browser window.

### Misc. 

* **Copy Chrome URL to keyboard** - Copies the web address currently open in Chrome to the system clipboard with a designated shortcut.
* **Make Quote** - Takes selected blocks of text and adds `>` quote tags before, on new lines where appropriate.
* **Wrap in Para tags** - Pastes the current clipboard, wrapped in paragraph (`<p>`) tags.
